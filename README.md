# Election_Analysis

Project Overview

The Colorado Board of Elections needs to complete an audit of election results for a recent local congressional election.

The information needed from this audit are:

1. To calculate the total number of votes cast in this election
2. Calculate the number of votes per county
3. Calculate the percentage of total votes per county
4. Determine which county had the largest number of votes cast
5. Get a list of candidates 
6. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received
7. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate worn
8. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote
